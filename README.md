## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I used this challenge to practice React + Styled Components, which are a great combination!. I had some minor issues styling React Portals, but fixed it using global styles in order to apply some css to components like modals, which are out of scope of nested styled components.

### Continued development

In order to keep this project simple I avoided the use of Redux, some props are passed from parent to children and so on. I'm planning merge this architecture to Redux to make things easier to understand.
